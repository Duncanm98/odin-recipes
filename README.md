HTML Basics

https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

Create a simple html structured document akin to the bare bones needed for a food blog that includes an index page with links to three internal pages for different recipes. The

html knowledge tested on the use of:
- img tags,
- a tags
- ul / ol / li 

With a prior knowledge of html/css I prepped for future additions to this project by using sections, spans, divs, and class tags.

The Cascade

Stylize the above with external css

css knowledge tested on the use of:

- linking stylesheet to html pages
- text color
- background colors
- styling typograghy

Renamed and added classes to html elements. Used prior knowledge of dispaly:flex on the index page to make a responsive page so that the links wouldn't be touching each other. Stylized the index in polaroid fasion that framed the image of the recipe with the title with opacity and hover effects. Internal recipe pages are pseudo-responsive by being constrained to the width of the element with typography styling.

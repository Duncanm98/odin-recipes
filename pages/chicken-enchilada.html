                <li><span class="bold-text">Cook Ingredients:</span> Heat a skillet over medium heat and add oil.

                <li><span class="bold-text">Assemble the Enchiladas:</span> Gently heat the tortillas to make them easier to roll - about 10-15 seconds per side for until soft and pliable. Spread a spoonful of enchilada sauce onto the tortilla and then put a spoonful of the chicken mixture down the center, topping it with a sprinle of cheese.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Roll The Tortilla:</span> Fold over the ends where the center line of ingredients divide the tortilla and then roll it up.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Repeat The Process:</span> Go through the abovce steps for the rest of the tortilla to fill up your baking dish.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Top 'em Off:</span> Once the baking dish is full, spoon remaining enchilada sauce over each tortilla and then top it off with shredded cheese.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Bake:</span> Bake the enchiladas, uncovered, for 25 minutes. Top with any desired toppings and serve hot.</li>

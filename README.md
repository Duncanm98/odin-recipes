The Odin Project - Foundations Course

HTML Basics

https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

Created a simple html structured document akin to the bare bones needed for a food blog. Includes an index page with links to three internal pages for different recipes. The recipe pages utilized what was learned prior to this project with tags such as img tags, a tags, ul/ol/li elements. 

With a prior knowledge of html/css I prepped for future additions to this project by using sections, spans, divs, and class tags.

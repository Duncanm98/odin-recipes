            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Cut the potatoes.</span> Feel free to peel your potatoes or leave the skins on.  
                    Then cut them into evenly-sized chunks, about an inch or so thick, 
                    and transfer them to a large stockpot full of cold water. </li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Boil the potatoes.</span> Once all of your potatoes are cut, be 
                    sure that there is enough cold water in the pan so that the water line sits about 1 inch above the potatoes.  Stir the garlic and 1 tablespoon sea salt into the water.  Then turn the heat to high and cook until the water comes to a boil.  
                    Reduce heat to medium-high (or whatever temperature is needed to maintain the boil) 
                    and continue cooking for about 10-12 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the middle 
                    of a potato goes in easily with almost no resistance.  Carefully drain out all of 
                    the water.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Prepare your melted butter mixture.</span> Meanwhile, as the potatoes are boiling, 
                    heat the butter, milk and an additional 2 teaspoons of sea salt together either 
                    in a small saucepan or in the microwave until the butter is just melted.  
                    (You want to avoid boiling the milk.)  Set aside until ready to use.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Pan-dry the potatoes.</span>  After draining the water, immediately return the potatoes 
                    to the hot stockpot, place it back on the hot burner, and turn the heat down to 
                    low.  Using two oven mitts, carefully hold the handles on the stockpot and shake 
                    it gently on the burner for about 1 minute to help cook off some of the remaining 
                    steam within the potatoes.  Remove the stockpot entirely from the heat and set 
                    it on a flat, heatproof surface.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Mash the potatoes.</span>  Using your preferred kind of potato masher, mash the potatoes to your desired 
                    consistency.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Stir everything together.</span>  Then pour half of the melted butter mixture over the 
                    potatoes, and fold it in with a wooden spoon or spatula until potatoes have soaked 
                    up the liquid.  Repeat with the remaining butter, and then again with the cream 
                    cheese, folding in each addition in until just combined to avoid over-mixing.  
                    (Feel free to add in more warm milk to reach your desired consistency, if needed.)</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Taste and season.</span>  One final time, taste the potatoes and season with extra 
                    salt if needed.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Serve warm.</span>  Then serve warm, garnished with gravy or any extra toppings that 
                    you might like, and enjoy!</li>
